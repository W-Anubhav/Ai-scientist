# GraphRAG Implementation in This Application

## ✅ YES - GraphRAG is Used!

This application **does use GraphRAG** (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Here's how:

### 1. **GraphCypherQAChain** - The Core GraphRAG Component

Located in `tools.py`, the application uses `GraphCypherQAChain` from LangChain, which is a **GraphRAG implementation**:

```python
from langchain_community.chains.graph_qa.cypher import GraphCypherQAChain

cypher_chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    graph=graph,
    verbose=True,
    return_intermediate_steps=True
)
```

### How GraphRAG Works Here:

1. **User asks a question** (e.g., "What are all entities related to Alzheimer's disease?")

2. **LLM generates Cypher query** - The Gemini model translates the natural language question into a Cypher query

3. **Query Neo4j graph** - The Cypher query is executed against your Neo4j knowledge graph

4. **Retrieve relevant information** - The graph returns entities, relationships, and connections

5. **LLM generates answer** - The retrieved graph data is passed back to the LLM to generate a natural language answer

### GraphRAG Flow:

```
User Question 
    ↓
LLM (Gemini) → Generates Cypher Query
    ↓
Neo4j Graph → Executes Query → Returns Graph Data
    ↓
LLM (Gemini) → Generates Natural Language Answer
    ↓
User receives answer
```

### Where GraphRAG is Used:

1. **Query Graph Tab** (`app.py` Tab 2):
   - Direct GraphRAG queries using `cypher_chain.invoke()`
   - Users can ask questions and get answers from the knowledge graph

2. **AI Scientist Crew** (`agents.py`):
   - The Graph Analyst agent uses `GraphTools.query_graph()` 
   - This tool internally uses GraphRAG to query the graph
   - Agents can discover connections and generate hypotheses based on graph data

### Benefits of GraphRAG:

- **Semantic Understanding**: LLM understands the question context
- **Precise Retrieval**: Cypher queries retrieve exact graph relationships
- **Contextual Answers**: LLM synthesizes graph data into coherent answers
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Can find indirect connections through graph traversal

### This is NOT just RAG - It's GraphRAG:

- **Regular RAG**: Vector search → Retrieve documents → Generate answer
- **GraphRAG**: Natural language → Generate graph query → Retrieve graph relationships → Generate answer

The graph structure allows for:
- Relationship traversal
- Multi-hop queries
- Pattern discovery
- Connection analysis

## Summary

✅ **Yes, this application uses GraphRAG** via LangChain's `GraphCypherQAChain`
✅ The knowledge graph (Neo4j) is queried using AI-generated Cypher queries
✅ Answers are generated by combining graph retrieval with LLM reasoning
✅ This enables sophisticated knowledge discovery beyond simple document search
